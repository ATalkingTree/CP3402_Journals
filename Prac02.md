# Content Insights
About WordPress: pages are static, usually use to display information that doesn't change frequently. Posts are more dynamic, usually for article or blogposts. Bllocks are individual units of content like texts, medias, buttons, and used to make pages and posts.

About CMS: can be used to create, manage, and publish website without needing much coding skills. It can also provide lots of tools and customisations that are easy to use and deploy.

About Joomla: Joomla is open-source and have a large and active community to provide free resource, advice, and support. This can be a plus side compare to other CMS.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
WordPress has a more user-friendly interface, and seems easier to use than Joomla. The amount of plugins and themes available for WordPress is more abundant as well. By learning to use both of them, I can compare and choose which one to keep using for the future.
