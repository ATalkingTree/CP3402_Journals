# Estimated Hours
I spent 3 hours learning new stuff this week, not including time spent to revise old stuff

# Content Insights
This week I learned about Bootstrap, which is a library of css frameworks available online, and that their templates could be used to quickly build a website, saving me time doing trivial tasks.  

I learned that Github Pages can be used to host a very simple static website, hosted using my existed Github repository. I also used Microsoft Azure to host my website, preparing myself for dynamic web hosting later on.  

I could either use Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, both can easily be scaled based on the resources I need. Both also have pay-as-you-go model, excellent security, hybrid cloud capabilities, and both are famous big companies. I chose Azure because they gave me $100 credit instead of $50 like Google.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Bootstrap helped me familiarized with a widely used CSS framework. I could use it to quickly build a website and save myself a lot of time that would otherwise be sent on other task. Good time management can make me more productive and valuable to my employer.  

By using Github Pages and Microsoft Azure to host my website, I have gained experience with different web hosting services. This can be beneficial when seeking employment in web development, as many employers require experience with different web hosting services.
