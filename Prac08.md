# Learning Activities
This week, I did a "learning experiment" to test out if the learning method I chose help me learning better than in previous weeks

# Estimated Hours
4.5 hours

# Experiment
Background context: I usually study in big chunk of time (like 1.5 to 2 hours at a time), so I usually got burnt out at the end of the study session if the amount of content is too much. And according to the [website above](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/studying-101-study-smarter-not-harder) in the links section, shorter, intensive study times are more effective than drawn out studying. Therefore, I'll try another study technique called [Pomodoro study technique](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-pomodoro-technique-is-it-right-for-you.html). The technique involves breaking work or study sessions into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, called "pomodoros," followed by short breaks.

Theory: If I use the Pomodoro technique to study, it will improve my focus and productivity more than traditional uninterrupted study sessions. This can be measured by the amount of information I retent after a week, and how enjoyable the study session is at the end.

Test: I use the Pomodoro technique to study for an entire week every time I study. I will set an alarm to let me know if a study session (25 minutes) is over, as well as when a break period (5 minutes) is over. And if I only use this technique for this subject, the amount of hours studying will not be that big for testing. So I will use it for all of my other subjects as well.

Result: I cannot say if the technique helps me with information retention because I only tested this out for one week. If I have more time to test, I could probably test about that. However, this technique did help me with burnout and enhanced my focus. Regular breaks refreshed my mind and when I came back to study again, it helped me see things with a fresh perspective. Nontheless, this technique is not a one-size-fits-all solution. This technique disrupt the momentum of tasks that require prolonged concentration like coding.

# Insights
Conclusion: While this technique helped with my burnout and my focus, it's essential to assess new studying technique and its suitability for my specific circumstances, and make adjustments as necessary to optimize my study habits. This technique also help me with time management skills, because I have to divide my tasks into smaller bits to fit in the 25 minutes session. And finally, this technique help me overcome my procrastination (a little bit) because the amount of tasks got broken down, making it become easier to start the task, and I can achieve the goal I set faster.
