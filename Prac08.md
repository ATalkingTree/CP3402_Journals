This prac only requires a learning journal.

For this week, do some kind of "learning experiment" (or experiments). Use some form of the scientific method with a theory and test.
Determine a theory you have about a learning activity or method that you think might help you learn better than in previous weeks. This must be testable.
Determine a test that would allow you to prove or disprove your theory.
Explain the theory and test in the "Learning Activities" section in sufficient detail that someone else could read, understand and follow your test(s).

As usual, describe your learning insights in the final section of your journal.
