# Content Insights
Choosing a good hosting provider could be very important because their service will provide more support in case thing goes wrong. 

WordPress provides a very wide range of themes and plugins to help with website building and make trivial tasks easier. 

It is recommended to have 3 staging environment while building your website - local server to work on, staging server for internal testing as well as feedbacks, and production server for the live site.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Having 3 different environmment for developing is more professional, reduce risks about bugs and errors to the live site while experimenting with new features and plugins, enhanced collaboration efficiency between multiple team members simultaneously, and finally, collecting feedbacks from client for quality assurance without affecting the live site. 

A good group member must have good communication skills, like active listening, proving feedbacks, and communicate their needs and opinions effectively. They also should have a good attitude and be respectful to not bring down the morale of the group. And finally, they should actively participate in the group activities to contribute their ideas.
