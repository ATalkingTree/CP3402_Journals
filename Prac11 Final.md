# Learning Activities
Throughout my learning journey, I have engaged in various practical activities that have expanded my knowledge and skills in web development.

In Practical 3, I explored the importance of selecting a reliable hosting provider and leveraging the wide range of themes and plugins offered by WordPress. I understood the benefits of having three staging environments (local, staging, and production) during website development, facilitating efficient testing, collaboration, and quality assurance. Effective communication skills, a positive attitude, and active participation were identified as crucial attributes for productive group work.

During Practical 4, I learned about child themes in WordPress. Child themes consist of separate CSS and PHP files, allowing for easy customization of the parent theme's style and functionality. This separation provides greater control, making it possible to make changes without affecting the existing theme. Furthermore, I recognized the significance of backups in website development to safeguard against unforeseen events and enable quick restoration.

In Practical 6, I delved into PHP, an embedded language used in web development. PHP's server-side nature ensures enhanced security by keeping the code on the server. It facilitates the creation of dynamic web pages and enables seamless interaction with databases, making it essential for developing dynamic web applications. Additionally, I gained insights into effective collaboration and project management through my contributions to a group assignment.

During Practical 7, I explored building themes for WordPress using the lightweight starter theme, _s. This highly customizable theme contains only essential files and features, allowing users to tailor their themes to specific requirements. I also delved into the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) development, emphasizing the importance of efficient and reusable code.

In Practical 8, I experimented with the Pomodoro study technique to improve focus and productivity. While its impact on information retention required further testing, I found that the technique helped me combat burnout and maintain concentration. It highlighted the importance of assessing new studying techniques, making adjustments, and optimizing study habits based on individual needs.

# Insights
By combining the knowledge gained from these practicals, I have cultivated a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of web development, including study techniques, theme building, PHP, child themes, hosting considerations, and collaborative practices. These experiences have contributed to my personal and professional growth, emphasizing the significance of adaptability, continuous learning, and effective communication in the field of web development.
