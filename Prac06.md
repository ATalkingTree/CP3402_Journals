# Content Insights
PHP is an embedded language, meaning that it got mixed or embedded in HTML markup. It is also a server-side technology, which means the PHP code stays on the server, and after it has been processed, it sends back the resulting HTML to the client's browser. 

PHP helps improve security of web applications because the client does not have direct access to the code, making it more difficult for malicious users to exploit vulnerabilities in the code.

PHP allows developers to create dynamic web pages because it generates contents dynamically based on various conditions and inputs. PHP also making it easy to connect to and interact with databases to retrieve, store, and manipulate data. This capability is crucial for creating dynamic web applications
